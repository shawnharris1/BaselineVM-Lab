# Clean Baseline Snapshot Guide

This document outlines how to preserve a clean, reusable snapshot of your baseline VMs after provisioning.

## Snapshot vs. Export

- Snapshots are Hyper-V checkpoints stored locally.  
- Exports are full VM copies saved externally for backup or sharing.


## Why Snapshot?

Creating a snapshot immediately after provisioning allows you to:

- Roll back to a known-good state
- Avoid re-running setup scripts
- Maintain consistency across lab sessions

## When to Snapshot

Take a snapshot after:

- Running `Provision-BaselineVMs.ps1`
- Verifying VM boot and ISO installation
- Confirming network connectivity and switch assignment

## Before You Snapshot

- Confirm VM boots cleanly and matches intended role
- Apply any required baseline hardening (e.g., SC-300 prep)
- Ensure VM is not joined to a domain unless intended
- Remove temporary files or setup artifacts
- Before snapshotting, ensure no sensitive credentials or lab secrets are stored in plaintext.

## Snapshot Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your VM is clean, functional, and ready for snapshotting

- [ ] VM boots cleanly
- [ ] ISO installation verified
- [ ] Network switch assigned
- [ ] Baseline hardening applied (if applicable)
- [ ] Temporary files removed
- [ ] Snapshot named using convention

## Snapshot Naming Convention

Use the following format:

[VMName]-CleanBaseline-[YYYYMMDD]


Example:

Baseline-Win11-CleanBaseline-20250929


## Snapshot Location

Snapshots are stored in Hyper-V and optionally exported to:

P:\BaselineVM\Snapshots\


## Exporting Snapshots (Optional)

To export a snapshot for backup or sharing:

1. Open Hyper-V Manager
2. Right-click the VM â†’ Export
3. Choose `P:\BaselineVM\Snapshots\` as the destination

## Notes

- Snapshots are not substitutes for full backups
- Always teardown before re-provisioning to avoid conflicts
- Document changes in `Docs/SetupNotes.md` if modifying the baseline
